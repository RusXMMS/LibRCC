0.2.1:
    - "ctype" should be known class. In the XMMS patch just describe how the playlist patch
    can be altered from "ctype" to "id3" in the case mpg123 patches are not applied.
	+ Problem. Some times there are broken 'ogg' tags with CP1251 instead of unicode
	inside. Dissabling autodetection for them will cause incorrect encoding to be
	displayed.
    - If autodetected charset is disabled treat the autodetection failed.
    - If Locale Language is English, - resolve default charset to "Off".
    - Don't try to translate if postponed translate failed (for some time)
    - Solve mpg123 slowdown.

0.3.x:
    - Shall we always return result even if recoding is not required (not a NULL as now)?
    Currently we have no way to know if something is failed or if we just have a correct
    string already...
    - Language and Encoding autodetection improvements.
	+ LibRCD should use DB4 with statistic for different languages
	+ The statistic should be gathered using:
	    * Aspell dictionaries.
	    * Special program getting text on the standard input.
	    * From LibRCC when language is preciesely detected.
	+ The LibRCD engine should be used to fast language detection as well.
	    * Just analyze output UTF8 string
	+ Add ispell support
    - Translation improvemtns
	+ Look if there are any offline translation libraries available.
	+ Use stardict (or other dictionary) to translate on per-word basis.
	+ Try to translate to first parrent encoding if translation to the current one is failed.
	+ Transliterate support for more languages. 

0.4.x:
    - Buffer managment:
	+ SetBufferSize ( 0 - autogrow )
    - Move all recoding functionality on the rccConfig Level
    - Revise Locking Subsystem
    - Load class configurations from the XML files.


0.5.x:
    - Special encoding.
	+ Instead of IConv call considered function.
	    * For example: Transliterate
	    * For example: Translate to English
	+ The options for encoding should be passed as a part of encoding name.
	    * Develope naming conventions
	+ Pluggable special encodings.
	
1.0.x:
    - Switch to Get/Ref/UnRef calls.
    - Drop down 'Class' keywords in all 'ClassCharset' function. Make it default behaviour.

on request:
    - Multibyte(not-UTF8) support for FS classes
