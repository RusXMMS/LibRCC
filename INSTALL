Dependencies
============
    LibRCC is dependent on LibXML2 library. However it requires some other 
    libraries to provide considered services.
    
    * LibRCD and Enca libraries are used to provide encoding autodetection.
    * DB4 is used to cache translations and recodings. 
    * Aspell is required for language autodetection.
    * LibTranslate is required for translation. 
	o The Libtranslate uses online services to translate the text. In the 
	defaultIt version there are no ways to limit translation time. The 
	LibRCC will respect the maximum time for recoding in any case, but
	nevertheless it will be good idea to use patched version of Libtranslate,
	providing API call to make time limited translate. The patch can be
	downloaded from the RusXMMS(http://RusXMMS.sf.net) project page.

    The configure script will report which options are available.


Build
=====
    LibRCC utilizes standard GNU autoconf build system. To build LibRCC release
    you should type:
	./configure
	make
    
    Installation can be performed using following command:
	make install
    
    The configure script accepts following options:
    --enable-force-dynamic-engines:
	Will force encoding autodetection to load Enca and LibRCD libraries
	dynamically, rather than compiling them in.
    --disable-libtranslate:
	Will not compile support for language translation.
	Even if Libtranslate library is available.
